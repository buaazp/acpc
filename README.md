# acpc

**One terminal UI for every coding agent.**

acpc puts any [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) agent
(Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Goose, or your own) inside the OpenAI Codex
terminal UI. You get streaming answers, tool calls with diffs, approvals,
plans, session history and a slash-command popup, all on top of an agent you
choose. Switch agents mid-conversation and take the conversation with you.

```sh
acpc add "opencode acp"
acpc add --name Claude npx -y @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@latest
acpc
```

## Why acpc

- **Bring your own agent.** acpc ships no agents and favours none. Anything
  that speaks ACP over stdio works, from a one-line `acpc add`.
- **A real terminal UI.** acpc reuses the Codex TUI at a pinned upstream
  commit, plus a small patch series. Rendering, diffs, approvals and history
  all work like in Codex.
- **Switch without starting over.** `/agent` can fork your conversation onto
  another agent. The conversation stays on screen, the new agent gets it as
  context, and the original session stays one `/resume` away.
- **The agent's own controls.** Its models and reasoning levels appear in
  `/model`, its modes on Shift+Tab, its other settings in `/options`, and its
  slash commands in the `/` popup. Approval prompts offer exactly the options
  the agent sent.
- **Faithful ACP v1.** acpc implements the full client side of ACP v1:
  - sessions: new, load, resume, list, close, delete
  - permissions and elicitation, as forms or links
  - config options and modes
  - available commands
  - sign-in through agent or terminal methods
  - cancellation, including of pending requests
- **Nothing extra.** No telemetry, no local transcripts, no sandbox, no shell
  of its own. Agents use their own tools, and acpc never touches your
  credentials.

## Install

On Linux and macOS:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AkaraChen/acpc/main/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AkaraChen/acpc/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The script downloads the latest
[release](https://github.com/AkaraChen/acpc/releases) for your platform,
verifies its checksum and installs `acpc` into `~/.local/bin`
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\acpc` on Windows). Set `ACPC_VERSION=v0.1.0` to
pin a release or `ACPC_INSTALL_DIR` to install elsewhere. Run it again to
update.

Then add an agent and start:

```sh
acpc add "opencode acp"
acpc
```

## Build from source

You need Rust (the toolchain installs itself from `rust-toolchain.toml`),
`git`, a C compiler, OpenSSL headers and [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AkaraChen/acpc && cd acpc
scripts/sync-upstream          # fetch Codex at the pinned commit, apply patches/
just build                     # → target/debug/acpc
```

Put `target/debug/acpc` on your `PATH`. The first build compiles the Codex
workspace and takes a while. Install [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold)
and `just` links with it automatically, so later rebuilds relink in seconds.

Pushing a `v*` tag builds release archives for Linux (musl), macOS and
Windows and publishes them on a GitHub Release.

## Adding agents

`acpc add` takes the command that starts an agent in ACP mode, as one quoted
string or as plain words:

```sh
acpc add "opencode acp"
acpc add npx -y @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@latest   # slug: claude-agent-acp
acpc add --slug gemini --name Gemini --default npx -y @google/gemini-cli --experimental-acp
```

- **Slug:** taken from the program name, or for launchers (`npx`, `uvx`,
  `pnpm dlx`, …) from the package name. Pass `--slug` to choose your own.
- **Options:** `--slug`, `--name` and `--default` go before the command.
- **Default agent:** the first agent you add becomes the default. Later ones
  don't replace it unless you pass `--default`.
- **The file:** `acpc add` appends to `~/.config/acpc/config.toml` (or
  `$ACPC_CONFIG`) and keeps your comments.

Everything `add` writes can also be edited by hand:

```toml
agent = "claude"                         # default agent

[[agents]]
slug = "claude"
name = "Claude"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@latest"]
# env = { SOME_VAR = "value" }
# default_model = "opus"                       # forced at spawn through:
# model_override = { env = "ANTHROPIC_MODEL" } # or { arg = "--model" }

# MCP servers passed to every session
# [[mcp_servers]]
# name = "files"
# command = "mcp-files"                  # stdio; a bare name is looked up on PATH
# url = "https://…"; transport = "http"  # or "sse"
```

## Using it

```sh
acpc                     # new session with the default agent
acpc -a gemini "prompt"  # pick an agent, optionally with a first prompt
acpc -C ~/src/project    # working directory for the session
acpc resume [ID|--last]  # reopen a session (agents with session/list + load/resume)
acpc login               # sign in with the agent's ACP method, then exit
acpc app-server          # headless: the Codex app-server protocol on stdio
```

Inside the TUI:

| | |
|---|---|
| `/agent` | Switch agents. If the session has messages, choose **Bring this conversation** to fork it onto the new agent, or **Start fresh**. |
| `/model` | The agent's models and reasoning levels. |
| `/options` | The agent's other session settings and modes. |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle the agent's modes. |
| `/resume` | Reopen an earlier session, including forks; they show where they came from. |
| `/` | The agent's own slash commands, alongside acpc's. |

### Agent response formatting

ACP replies are rendered as Markdown. ANSI colors and text styles included in
an agent's replies (for example, BBilingual's gray translation lines) are decoded
before wrapping, so style codes do not appear as text or distort column widths.
Markdown headings, lists, tables and code keep their normal layout.

Claude Code plugins that only change Claude's own UI must expose their output
through the remote agent to appear here. Display-only translations may not be
included when the agent replays a saved session.

### Signing in

When an agent answers `auth_required`, acpc offers the sign-in methods the
agent advertises. That can happen at startup, when you switch to it, or on
your first prompt.

- **`agent` methods** sign in through ACP `authenticate`.
- **`terminal` methods** hand your terminal to the agent's own login program,
  then restart the agent.
- **Forms** the agent asks for while signing in are answered right there.
- **Risky environment overrides** (`PATH`, `LD_*`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, proxies, …)
  are shown and confirmed before they run.

`acpc login` signs in without opening a session.

### Headless: `acpc app-server`

`acpc app-server` speaks the Codex app-server protocol on stdin/stdout, backed
by your ACP agent. Tools built to drive Codex can drive any ACP agent through
it.

## How it works

```
 Codex TUI (upstream, pinned + patches/)
     │  Codex app-server protocol (WebSocket over a private unix socket)
 acp-bridge   emulates a Codex app-server: threads/turns/items ⇄ ACP sessions/updates
     │  ACP v1 (JSON-RPC over stdio)
 acp-client   the official Rust SDK plus ACP client semantics
     │
 your agent process (from config.toml)
```

The TUI already talks to its backend through the app-server protocol.
acpc gives it a backend that translates that protocol into ACP:
- **Threads and turns:** a thread is an agent session, and a turn is a prompt.
- **Session updates** become items: messages, reasoning, plans, commands,
  diffs, tool calls.
- **Approvals and forms:** agent permission requests become approval prompts,
  and elicitations become forms.
- **History:** reopening a session rebuilds it from the agent's `session/load`
  replay.

The TUI changes stay small and switched off unless acpc enables them:
`patches/` is about 130 KB in total.

## Scope

acpc is a client for ACP v1 and nothing more:

- It doesn't advertise the optional `fs/*` and `terminal/*` client
  capabilities, so agents use their own file system and shell.
- After an agent restarts (a crash, or a terminal sign-in), reopen its earlier
  sessions with `/resume`.
- Codex's own features that only make sense with Codex are hidden: cloud,
  sandboxing, review, worktrees and the like.

## Development

```sh
just check    # type-check acpc's crates
just test     # unit, bridge integration and protocol-contract tests
just smoke    # drive the real TUI in tmux against two mock agents
just clippy
```

- **Integration tests:** they run the bridge in-process against
  `acpc-mock-agent`, a scriptable ACP agent. Every message the bridge sends is
  also decoded with the Codex protocol types the TUI uses. Protocol drift
  fails a test instead of being silently dropped by the TUI.
- **Smoke test:** `scripts/smoke-tui` checks a conversation, a tool call,
  `/options`, `/agent` and a clean exit.

### Upstream and patches

`UPSTREAM` pins the openai/codex commit acpc builds against.
`third_party/codex/` is a generated checkout of it with the patch series
applied. `patches/*.patch` are the patches, in order:

1. Add acpc's crates to the Codex workspace, and drop its V8-based members so
   the build never fetches V8.
2. The `acpc/*` protocol extension (agent commands, session options and modes,
   notices, agents, sign-in, terminal handoff), and acpc mode in the TUI.
3. Agent slash commands in the composer; Codex-only built-ins hidden.
4. `/agent` (including forking a conversation onto another agent), `/options`,
   mode cycling, the sign-in picker and the terminal handoff.
5. Approval prompts with the agent's own permission options.
6. Number and multi-select fields in elicitation forms.
7. Upstream schema fixture tests skipped, since the fixtures don't include
   `acpc/*`.
8. ANSI styles in ACP replies decoded before Markdown wrapping and table layout.

To change upstream code:
1. Edit and commit in `third_party/codex`.
2. Run `scripts/export-patches`.

To move to a newer Codex:
1. Update `UPSTREAM`.
2. Run `scripts/sync-upstream`.
3. Resolve any conflicts (`git am --continue` in `third_party/codex`).
4. Export the patches, rebuild, and run `just lock`.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `crates/acp-client` | ACP client: process spawn, initialize, sessions, permissions, elicitation, cancellation |
| `crates/acp-bridge` | The app-server emulator: thread/turn/item state, history rebuild, approvals, forks |
| `crates/acpc` | The binary: config, `add`, sign-in, TUI launch, `app-server` |
| `crates/mock-agent` | Scriptable ACP agent for tests |
